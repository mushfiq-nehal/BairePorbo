 * The I/O and vocabulary layer both roadmap routes share.
 *
 * Everything impure about the roadmap lives here: the four user-scoped reads, the
 * single upsert, and `toWire` — the one place the engine's camelCase types and
 * the hand-written snake_case wire shapes in `packages/shared` meet. The engine
 * stays free to refactor because nothing outside this file imports its types.
 *
 * The `@baireporbo/shared` import is **type-only**, resolved through a
 * `tsconfig.json` path rather than a package dependency: it makes a mismatch
 * between what a handler emits and what a client expects a compile error here
 * instead of a bug on a device. Importing a *value* from that package would need
 * `transpilePackages` in `next.config.ts`, because it ships TypeScript source.
 *
 * Not a route: the App Router only treats `route.ts` as an endpoint, so a
 * colocated module is the normal place for the pieces two sibling handlers share.
