/**
 * `PATCH /api/roadmap/milestones/[key]` — a status write, and nothing else.
 *
 * The rule this route exists to enforce: **recording a status is not doing the
 * work.** It advances the path, unlocks what depends on it and fires the
 * completion feedback once — and it moves the score by zero, because the scorer
 * reads stored profile values and artefacts and never reads this table. `delta`
 * is computed as a difference rather than hardcoded, so the invariant is
 * observable in the response instead of merely believed.
 *
 * `manual_override` is always `true`: a student who touched a status has said
 * something the engine's auto-satisfaction must stop arguing with.
