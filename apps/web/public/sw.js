/**
 * BairePorbo Service Worker
 * Provides an offline shell so the app loads instantly on repeat visits
 * and shows a friendly offline page when there's no connection.
 *
 * Strategy:
 *  - App shell (HTML, logo, manifest) → Cache-first
 *  - API calls → Network-first (never serve stale scholarship data)
 *  - Next.js router/RSC data fetches → always network, never intercepted
 *  - Images → not intercepted at all (see below)
 *  - Everything else → Network-first with cache fallback, capped
